Testing data

- use in-memory database instead of on-disk database
- use a fake database object
- use fixture data (not recommended; it's brittle)
- use factories (more flexible than fixtures, but still slow)
- use test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies, etc)

RSpec documentation
- avoid rspec.info; it is waaaaay out of date
- Use https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/ to get an idea of what you can do
  - Core: covers describe, it, before, shared contexts, etc
  - Expectations: equality, identity, "truthiness and existentialism" :D
  - Mocks: stuff to do with test doubles
- Use RSpec's RDoc to find details about how a specific method works
  - http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/
